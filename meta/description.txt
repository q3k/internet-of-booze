In A.D. 2015 prohibition was beginning. Vokda prices have risen to sky-high levels! Vending machines won't accept anything but 50PLN for a shot of booze - what an outrage!

Our agents have acquired a [development]({{resource('photo-01.jpg')}})
[prototype]({{resource('photo-02.jpg')}}) of one of these machines, and it has
been transported to the Organizer's table. 

**This challenge is in two parts, this is the second.** They are in logical
order of solving, but feel free to solve them in whatever order you want.

50zł for a shot of vodka is outrageous! Bring down the government! Free vodka
for everyone? Why pay 50zł, when you can hack it and get it for free?

This [firmware dump]({{resource('main.elf')}}) is running at the organizers table. The phone number of the GSM modem is +48 500 803 730.

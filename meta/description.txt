In A.D. 2015 prohibition was beginning.

Vokda prices have risen to sky-high levels! Vending machines won't accept anything but 50PLN for a shot of booze - what an outrage!

Our agents have acquired a [development]({{resource('photo-01.jpg')}})
[prototype]({{resource('photo-02.jpg')}}) of one of these machines, and it's
in transit to the Organizer's table. It should arrive there in a few hours for
you to start experimenting with.

While looking through related assets, our agents have also uncovered a
[file]({{resource('main-prototype.elf')}}) that might be an earlier version of
the firmware running on the device. The final dump will be available once the
device appears on our premises. Can you find any hidden secrets or a way to
make the machine dispense free alcohol? You won't be able to find any flags
for now, but you can get a head start for what's to come when the system
arrives...

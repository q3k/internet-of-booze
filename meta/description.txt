In A.D. 2015 prohibition was beginning. Vokda prices have risen to sky-high levels! Vending machines won't accept anything but 50PLN for a shot of booze - what an outrage!

Our agents have acquired a [development]({{resource('photo-01.jpg')}})
[prototype]({{resource('photo-02.jpg')}}) of one of these machines, and it has
been transported to the Organizer's table. 

**This challenge is in two parts, this is the first.** They are in logical
order of solving, but feel free to solve them in whatever order you want.

Our agents have noticed that the technician servicing these machines use an
SMS interface to acquire information on the machine status, and the
Manufacturer has been boasting that their cryptography protecting this
endpoint is unbreakable. Can you break into it, and see the status of our
machine?

This [firmware dump]({{resource('main.elf')}}) is running at the organizers
table. The phone number of the GSM modem is +48 500 803 730.
